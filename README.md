# flask-blog

## Project Overview

This is my attempt at learning the **Flask Python framework**. The course I am following is titled the [_Python Flask Tutorial_](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH), created by [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms).

The application is a blog website that offers the following features:

- Visitors can register for an account.
- Registered users can log in using valid credentials.
- Users can view all posts available on the platform.
- Users can create new posts, as well as update or delete posts they have authored.
- Users can update their account details, including their username, email address, and password.
