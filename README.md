# flask-blog

## üìù Project Overview

This is my attempt at learning the **Flask Python framework**. I am following the [Python Flask Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) by [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/@coreyms).

The application is a blog website that offers the following features:

- Visitors can register for an account.
- Registered users can log in using valid credentials.
- Users can view all posts available on the platform.
- Users can create new posts, as well as update or delete posts they have authored.
- Users can update their account details, including their username, email address, and password.
- **Ideally, users would receive a token via email with instructions to reset their password. However, since I could not get the email service working, I instead flash the reset link directly to the user.**

I have completed the project. In the future, I would like to explore the Flask [Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) by [Miguel Grinberg](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/) to further enhance my knowledge. I plan to integrate additional concepts from the tutorial into this project.
